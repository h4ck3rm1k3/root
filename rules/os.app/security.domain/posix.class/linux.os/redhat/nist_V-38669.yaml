    check: 'Run the following command to determine the current status of the "postfix"
      service:


      # service postfix status


      If the service is enabled, it should return the following:


      postfix is running...


      If the service is not enabled, this is a finding.'
    fix: "The Postfix mail transfer agent is used for local mail delivery within the\
      \ system. The default configuration only listens for connections to the default\
      \ SMTP port (port 25) on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1). It is recommended\
      \ to leave this service enabled for local mail delivery. The \"postfix\" service\
      \ can be enabled with the following command: \n\n# chkconfig postfix on\n# service\
      \ postfix start"
    long_description: Local mail delivery is essential to some system maintenance
      and notification tasks.
    short_description: The postfix service must be enabled for mail delivery.
