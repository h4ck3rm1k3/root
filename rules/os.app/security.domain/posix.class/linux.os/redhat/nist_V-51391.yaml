    check: 'To find the location of the AIDE database file, run the following command:


      # grep DBDIR /etc/aide.conf


      Using the defined values of the [DBDIR] and [database] variables, verify the
      existence of the AIDE database file:


      # ls -l [DBDIR]/[database_file_name]


      If there is no database file, this is a finding.'
    fix: 'Run the following command to generate a new database:


      # /usr/sbin/aide --init


      By default, the database will be written to the file "/var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz".
      Storing the database, the configuration file "/etc/aide.conf", and the binary
      "/usr/sbin/aide" (or hashes of these files), in a secure location (such as on
      read-only media) provides additional assurance about their integrity. The newly-generated
      database can be installed as follows:


      # cp /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz /var/lib/aide/aide.db.gz


      To initiate a manual check, run the following command:


      # /usr/sbin/aide --check


      If this check produces any unexpected output, investigate.'
