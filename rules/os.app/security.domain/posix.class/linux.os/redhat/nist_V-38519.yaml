    check: 'The group-owner of all log files written by "rsyslog" should be root.
      These log files are determined by the second part of each Rule line in "/etc/rsyslog.conf"
      and typically all appear in "/var/log". To see the group-owner of a given log
      file, run the following command:


      $ ls -l [LOGFILE]


      Some log files referenced in /etc/rsyslog.conf may be created by other programs
      and may require exclusion from consideration.
