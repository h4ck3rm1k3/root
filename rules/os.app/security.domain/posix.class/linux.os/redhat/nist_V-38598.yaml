    check: 'To check that the "rexec" service is disabled in system boot configuration,
      run the following command:


      # chkconfig "rexec" --list


      Output should indicate the "rexec" service has either not been installed, or
      has been disabled, as shown in the example below:


      # chkconfig "rexec" --list

      rexec off

      OR

      error reading information on service rexec: No such file or directory



      If the service is running, this is a finding.'
    fix: "The \"rexec\" service, which is available with the \"rsh-server\" package\
      \ and runs as a service through xinetd, should be disabled. The \"rexec\" service\
      \ can be disabled with the following command: \n\n# chkconfig rexec off"
    long_description: The rexec service uses unencrypted network communications, which
      means that data from the login session, including passwords and all other information
      transmitted during the session, can be stolen by eavesdroppers on the network.
    short_description: The rexecd service must not be running.
