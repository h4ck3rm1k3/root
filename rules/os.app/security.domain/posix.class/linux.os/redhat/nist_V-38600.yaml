    check: 'The status of the "net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects" kernel parameter
      can be queried by running the following command:


      $ sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects


      The output of the command should indicate a value of "0". If this value is not
      the default value, investigate how it could have been adjusted at runtime, and
      verify it is not set improperly in "/etc/sysctl.conf".


      $ grep net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects /etc/sysctl.conf


      If the correct value is not returned, this is a finding.'
    fix: "To set the runtime status of the \"net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects\"\
      \ kernel parameter, run the following command: \n\n# sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects=0\n\
      \nIf this is not the system's default value, add the following line to \"/etc/sysctl.conf\"\
      : \n\nnet.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0"
    long_description: Sending ICMP redirects permits the system to instruct other
      systems to update their routing information. The ability to send ICMP redirects
      is only appropriate for systems acting as routers.
    short_description: The system must not send ICMPv4 redirects by default.
