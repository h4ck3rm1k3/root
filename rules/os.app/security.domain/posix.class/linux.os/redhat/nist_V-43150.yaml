    check: 'If the GConf2 package is not installed, this is not applicable.


      To ensure the user list is disabled, run the following command:


      $ gconftool-2 --direct \

      --config-source xml:readwrite:/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.mandatory \

      --get /apps/gdm/simple-greeter/disable_user_list


      The output should be "true". If it is not, this is a finding.'
    fix: 'In the default graphical environment, users logging directly into the system
      are greeted with a login screen that displays all known users. This functionality
      should be disabled.


      Run the following command to disable the user list:


      $ sudo gconftool-2 --direct \

      --config-source xml:readwrite:/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.mandatory \

      --type bool --set /apps/gdm/simple-greeter/disable_user_list true'
    long_description: Leaving the user list enabled is a security risk since it allows
      anyone with physical access to the system to quickly enumerate known user accounts
      without logging in.
    short_description: The login user list must be disabled.
