    fix: 'To ensure the system can cryptographically verify base software packages
      come from Red Hat (and to connect to the Red Hat Network to receive them), the
      Red Hat GPG keys must be installed properly. To install the Red Hat GPG keys,
      run:

      If the system is not connected to the Internet or an RHN Satellite, then install
      the Red Hat GPG keys from trusted media such as the Red Hat installation CD-ROM
      or DVD. Assuming the disc is mounted in "/media/cdrom", use the following command
      as the root user to import them into the keyring:


      # rpm --import /media/cdrom/RPM-GPG-KEY'
